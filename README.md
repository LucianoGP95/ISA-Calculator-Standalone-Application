# ISA-Calculator-Standalone-Application
A simple standalone app made in AppDesigner, Matlab, that is able to determine standard atmosphere conditions as a function of altitude in several commonly used units. Graphical representations are included.

Features:
-Quick calculations of Temperature, Pressure and Density at any altitude between 0-20 km a.s.l.
-Serveral unit systems commonly units used for these physical properties can be switched "on the fly", avoiding manual conversions.
-Graphical representations for each magnitude and each unit used allows for a better understanding of the underline math used for determining ISA conditions.

Requirements and limitations:
-An internet connection is required in order to download Matlab Runtime.
-Storage: 4 Gb for the full download of the Runtime. 2Gb for the full installation. App's size is meaningless in a modern platform.
-Tested on a Windows 10 platform. Should work in Linux and MACOS systems with the appropiate Runtime. 
-Tested using R2022(9.13) Matlab Runtime. This should be the automatically installed version of the Runtime.
